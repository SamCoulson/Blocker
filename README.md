Blocker
=======

Blocker is another Tetris clone written for the sole purpose of learning how to program in C++, write games and use SDL.

This game requires my gamelibrary in order to run, see 'gamelibrary' repository.  At the moment i statically link all the code togther, once i figure out and become comfortbale with dynamic linking i'll just include the .dll into the project instead requiring the 'gamelibrary' as well. 

All graphics have been created by the author.

Will probably add sounds soon.
